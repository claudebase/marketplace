# Reference Files Directory

Add detailed reference documentation here. Reference files are loaded
on-demand when the skill needs more detailed information.

## Naming Convention

Use kebab-case for reference file names:
- `methodology-details.md`
- `common-patterns.md`
- `troubleshooting-guide.md`

## Best Practices

1. Keep SKILL.md under 300 lines - use references for details
2. Reference files should be self-contained
3. Use clear section headings for easy navigation
4. Include practical examples with code snippets
