# Systematic Exploration Framework

## The DISCOVER Framework

### D - Define the Problem
- What is the actual problem (not the symptom)?
- Who experiences it?
- What's the impact of not solving it?
- How urgent is it?

### I - Investigate Current State
- How is it handled today?
- What works about current solutions?
- What doesn't work?
- What have others tried?

### S - Scope the Solution
- What's the minimum viable solution?
- What can be deferred?
- What are the hard constraints?
- What's negotiable?

### C - Consider Alternatives
- What are the different approaches?
- What are the trade-offs of each?
- What would experts recommend?
- What's unconventional but possible?

### O - Outline Requirements
- What are the must-haves?
- What are the nice-to-haves?
- What are the explicit non-goals?
- What are the success criteria?

### V - Validate Feasibility
- Is this technically achievable?
- Do we have the resources?
- What are the risks?
- What's the timeline?

### E - Extract Next Steps
- What's the first action?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What decisions are still open?
- When should we revisit?

## Exploration Depth Levels

### Shallow (5-10 minutes)
- Problem statement
- Key constraints
- One or two options
- Immediate next step

### Normal (15-30 minutes)
- Full DISCOVER cycle
- 3-5 alternative approaches
- Basic trade-off analysis
- Prioritized requirements list

### Deep (45-90 minutes)
- Multiple DISCOVER iterations
- Stakeholder perspectives
- Detailed feasibility analysis
- Comprehensive requirements document
- Risk assessment

## Domain-Specific Exploration

### Product/Feature Ideas
1. What user problem does this solve?
2. How big is the market/need?
3. What's the competitive landscape?
4. What's the business model?
5. What's the MVP look like?

### Technical Architecture
1. What are the scalability requirements?
2. What are the performance constraints?
3. What's the security posture needed?
4. What integrations are required?
5. What's the maintenance burden?

### Process/Workflow
1. Who are the stakeholders?
2. What are the handoff points?
3. Where are the bottlenecks?
4. What can be automated?
5. How will success be measured?

## Exploration Triggers

### When to Go Deeper
- User seems uncertain
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- High stakes decision
- Novel/unfamiliar domain
- Conflicting requirements

### When to Stay Shallow
- User has clear vision
- Low-risk decision
- Familiar problem space
- Time pressure
- Exploratory/experimental
