# Socratic Question Patterns

## Opening Questions

### Problem Discovery
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"
- "What sparked this idea?"
- "Who experiences this problem most acutely?"
- "How is this currently being handled?"

### Vision Exploration
- "What would the world look like if this existed?"
- "What would success look like for you?"
- "Who would benefit most from this?"
- "What's the dream scenario?"

### Context Gathering
- "What's your timeline for this?"
- "What resources do you have available?"
- "Is this for personal use, a startup, or enterprise?"
- "What's driving the urgency?"

## Clarifying Questions

### Scope Clarification
- "When you say X, do you mean A or B?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What's included in that and what's not?"
- "Is this for one user or many?"

### Priority Clarification
- "If you could only have one feature, which would it be?"
- "What's essential vs nice-to-have?"
- "What would you cut if timeline was halved?"
- "Which users are most important to serve first?"

### Technical Clarification
- "What technology constraints exist?"
- "What systems does this need to integrate with?"
- "What's the expected scale?"
- "Are there compliance requirements?"

## Challenging Questions

### Simplification Challenges
- "What's the simplest version that would still be useful?"
- "Can we start with X and add Y later?"
- "What if we didn't include that feature?"
- "Is there a manual workaround for now?"

### Assumption Challenges
- "Why do you think users need X?"
- "Have you validated this with potential users?"
- "What evidence supports that assumption?"
- "What if that assumption is wrong?"

### Feasibility Challenges
- "Do you have the skills/resources for this approach?"
- "What's the biggest risk to this working?"
- "What would make this fail?"
- "Is there a simpler alternative?"

## Synthesizing Questions

### Summary Confirmation
- "So the core problem is... does that sound right?"
- "It sounds like the key requirements are X, Y, Z - am I understanding correctly?"
- "So the priority order would be... correct?"
- "Let me reflect back what I'm hearing..."

### Trade-off Resolution
- "Between A and B, which matters more?"
- "If we can't have both, which would you choose?"
- "What are you willing to sacrifice for speed?"
- "How do you weigh X against Y?"

### Next Steps
- "What's the first thing we should tackle?"
- "What information do we still need?"
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What would make you confident to proceed?"

## Question Sequences by Scenario

### Vague Idea → Requirements
1. "What problem does this solve?"
2. "Who has this problem?"
3. "How do they solve it today?"
4. "What would be better about your solution?"
5. "What's the minimum version that would help?"

### Feature Request → Understanding
1. "What triggered this request?"
2. "What would you do with this feature?"
3. "How often would you use it?"
4. "What happens if we don't build it?"
5. "Is there another way to achieve this?"

### Technical Decision → Clarity
1. "What are the options you're considering?"
2. "What are the pros and cons of each?"
3. "What constraints are most important?"
4. "What's your gut telling you?"
5. "What would help you decide?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Do This
- Leading questions that assume an answer
- Multiple questions at once
- Yes/no questions when open-ended is better
- Questions that feel like interrogation
- Interrupting before the user finishes

### Do This Instead
- Open-ended exploration
- One question at a time
- Follow the user's thread
- Acknowledge before asking more
- Summarize understanding periodically
