# Sequential Thinking Skill

Structured problem-solving through iterative reasoning with revision and branching.

## Quick Reference

**Activates for**: think through, step by step, break down, analyze systematically, reason about
**Mode**: meta (reasoning orchestration)
**Output**: Structured thought chain with conclusions

## Workflow

```
THINK → ADJUST → REVISE → BRANCH → CONCLUDE
```

## When to Use

- Complex problems requiring multiple reasoning steps
- Uncertain scope or approach
- May need to backtrack or revise conclusions
- Exploring alternative solution paths

## When NOT to Use

- Simple queries with direct answers
- Single-step tasks
- Factual lookups

## References

- [Full Guide](references/guide.md) - Parameters, workflow patterns, examples
- [Advanced Usage](references/advanced.md) - Revision and branching patterns
- [Examples](references/examples.md) - Real-world use cases

## Boundaries

**Will**: Break down problems, track reasoning, revise conclusions, explore branches
**Will Not**: Make final decisions without evidence, skip verification steps
