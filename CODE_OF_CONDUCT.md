# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning
* Helping others improve their skills and contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Spamming issues or pull requests with off-topic content
* Submitting malicious code or intentionally introducing security vulnerabilities
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

In addition to the general standards above, we expect contributors to:

### Technical Conduct
* **Test before submitting**: Run the validation suite before opening pull requests
* **Follow the architecture**: Respect the plugin's structure (flat skills, flat agents, etc.)
* **Document your work**: Update documentation for any changes to functionality
* **No hardcoded secrets**: Always use environment variables for API keys and sensitive data
* **Security first**: Consider security implications of all changes

### Community Interaction
* **Be constructive**: When reviewing code or suggesting changes, be specific and helpful
* **Share knowledge**: Help others understand the codebase and development process
* **Assume good intent**: Give others the benefit of the doubt
* **Credit others**: Acknowledge contributions and inspirations from others

### Issue and PR Etiquette
* **Use templates**: Fill out issue and PR templates completely
* **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on the issue at hand
* **Be responsive**: Respond to feedback and questions in a timely manner
* **Close your own stale items**: If you're no longer working on something, let others know

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:
* GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions
* Code reviews and commit comments
* Community forums and chat channels
* Social media interactions related to the project
* In-person events and meetups

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**[CONTACT EMAIL - Replace this with your enforcement contact]**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting an incident, please include:
* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, including any relevant context
* Whether you believe the incident is ongoing
* Any additional information that may be helpful

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Security Considerations

As this project involves code execution and automation tools, we have additional
security-focused expectations:

* **No malicious code**: Never submit code intended to harm users, systems, or data
* **Responsible disclosure**: Report security vulnerabilities privately (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
* **No social engineering**: Don't trick users into exposing secrets or credentials
* **Respect privacy**: Don't collect or expose user data without explicit consent
* **Safe examples**: Ensure all examples and templates use safe defaults

Violations of security-focused guidelines may result in immediate permanent ban
and may be reported to relevant authorities.
